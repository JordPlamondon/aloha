# Aloha Project
This aloha project was made using HTML5, CSS3, and JQuery. 

CSS project 1 RED Academy

## Features

- CSS3
I used CSS3 to style and position the initial contents written in HTML5 using Flexbox, padding, colors, and fonts. I also utilized @media queries to enable the web page to become responsive and optimized for mobile, and desktop. 
- Html5
HTML5 was used to write out the content that was needed before any CSS was applied. Meta perameters and links were inserted at the top of the markup top ensure working CSS and Javascript content. Everything below the head was organized in a body, header, sections, and a footer, and then channeled into separate classes within them.

- jQuery
JQuery enabled me to insert a Flickity carousel into my project, thanks to the pre-determined code that their website offered.
I also enable the subscription button near the bottom of the project to alert the visiter when clicked (try again for invalid input, and a thank you when a correct email is given).


Comments:
It was a steep learning curve for me at first, and I had to restart once. On my second restart, I did a desktop-first approach, not realizing that a mobile-first approach would make it much easier. A couple of days before the due date, everything finally clicked and I understand where I went wrong, and what I did correctly. I had to work backwards from a desktop-first approach, so my page isn't perfectly responsive and my code is a little all over the place. I learned a ton from these mistakes, and I will go in and re-tweak everything when I can.
